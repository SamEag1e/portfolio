## Overview

This multi-phase project was my deep dive into data extraction, simple web app design, and bot-based user interfaces â€” all centered around one real-world goal: **estimate property prices from Divar listings.**

It started with scraping, pivoted to API-based collection, and eventually grew into a Django frontend and a Telegram bot for price queries. While none of the components are live or production-grade now, this archive captures my first end-to-end attempt at solving a real problem.

## Key Features

### Data Collection & Storage

- Initial attempt using **Scrapy + Selenium** (abandoned for performance and stability)
- Switched to **Divar's public API**, resulting in a fast, stable data crawler
- Stored data in MySQL using a **hand-rolled mini ORM**

### Analysis & Web Interface

- Built a **Django app** for calculating average price per meter
- Users could filter by location, category, and area
- Included blog, contact, and simple admin section (early learning effort)

### Telegram Bot for End Users

- Created a simple bot interface for real estate agents
- Users could get average price estimates directly in Telegram
- Supported basic filters and returned instant price metrics

## Lessons & Next Steps

- Learned the fundamentals of Scrapy, Selenium, and building a simple ORM from scratch
- Learned Django by hacking this together from scratch
- Telegram bots became a fun way to deliver utility

No plans to revive or maintain this, but the **idea still holds value**, and someday a cleaner version might resurface.
