# OHLCraft

> **Status:** In Development | Idea-to-Execution Phase  
> **Tech Stack:** Python • Planning for: Pytest • Docstrings • MetaTrader5

## Overview

**OHLCraft** is a work-in-progress Python project aimed at becoming a **minimal, beginner-friendly framework for building trading bots** — inspired by lessons learned while building [CustomTradeBot](../custom-trade-bot/overview.md).

While still in its early stages, the goal is to simplify the architecture of algo bots by focusing on:

- **Separation of concerns**
- **Modular strategy components**
- **Clear documentation and testability**

---

## Why Build This?

There are already mature trading bot frameworks out there — but most of them:

- Have steep learning curves
- Are designed for advanced use cases or large teams
- Mix too much logic in too few files (or too many abstractions with too little clarity)

OHLCraft is my attempt to create something **simple yet extensible**, something I wish existed when I first started.

---

## Core Vision

The project isn’t complete yet — but the **architecture is being shaped around real-world lessons**, including:

- How to keep strategy logic isolated and testable
- How to switch between backtest and live modes with minimal changes
- How to fail gracefully in production

Most components will be adapted and polished from CustomTradeBot, with improvements like:

- Docstrings and inline documentation
- Unit tests for core modules
- Clean logging and config control

---

## Current Progress

Right now, it’s just a [README with a roadmap](https://github.com/SamEag1e/OHLCraft) and some notes from CustomTradeBot.

But that’s how all open source starts — with an idea and the guts to build in public.

---

## Lessons & Next Steps

- Not every repo needs to be “done” to be valuable — this one is a **learning playground with serious potential**
- I’m planning to:
  - Start modularizing CustomTradeBot logic into standalone components
  - Add real documentation and tests
  - Explore a plug-and-play config layer for future users
