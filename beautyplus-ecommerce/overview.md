## 🧩 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **OTP-based login** using phone numbers — a secure, password-less approach

### 🛒 Modular E-Commerce Backend
- **Recursive product categories** using MPTT
- **Extensible Core Apps:** Built modular from day one — including Products, Carts, Orders, Notifications, Tags, and Accounts

### 🧠 Project Structure & Design Philosophy
- **Modular code structure**: Models, forms, and admin classes are split into separate modules — even for simpler apps
  - This design optimizes for long-term maintainability, localization (e.g., i18n), and easy admin customization
- Introduced a **service layer (singleton class per model)** to centralize business logic  
  - Inspired by best practices from **NestJS** and other backend frameworks  
  - Helps isolate logic and reduce tight coupling between apps

### 🔎 SEO & Social Media Optimization
- **Auto-generated meta tags** tailored for products, brands, and categories  
- Dynamic **Open Graph images (og:image)** for rich social media previews  
- **JSON-LD schema markup** for products to boost search engine understanding and rich results  
- Fully managed **sitemap generation** with Django to keep search engines updated  
- Clean, **smart hierarchical slugs** powering SEO-friendly URLs with clear category and product nesting  

### 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Dockerized** for consistent and portable deployments  
- Configured **Nginx** as a reverse proxy with **Certbot** for automated SSL certificates  
- DNS managed via **Cloudflare** for performance and security  
- **Cron jobs** set up for routine maintenance tasks

### 🔄 Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Automated daily backups using `rclone` to Google Drive  
- Backups are lightweight, encrypted, and versioned to ensure data integrity and project continuity

## 🧠 Lessons & Next Steps
- Explored Django’s **GenericForeignKey**, `ContentType`, and `GenericRelation` mechanics
- Ultimately chose **explicit, readable design** over abstract “magic”:
  - Ratings implemented via a `BaseRate` model inherited per target type, even though this feature is not yet live on the UI (e.g., `ProductRate`, `BlogRate`)
  - Categories follow the same logic (`BaseCategory` → `ProductCategory`, `BlogCategory`, etc.)
- Result: **clearer models**, **cleaner queries**, better admin integration, and more maintainable code
- Learned deep integrations of Django with real deployment scenarios
- Future plans: Add payment gateway, refine order flow, improve admin UX
